# PlanZ (aka Zambia)

![PlanZ Logo](./webpages/images/Plan-Z-Logo-192.png)

PlanZ is a convention scheduling tool originally developed for Arisia.
PlanZ tracks sessions (events, panels, and anything that needs to be scheduled),
participants, and rooms. PlanZ is a fork of [Zambia](https://github.com/olszowka/Zambia/);
enough changes have been made to the Zambia codebase that we decided a new
name was in order.

## Features
* Track sessions, rooms, and participants
* Comprehensive conflict checking
* Participants log in to enter availability, provide biography, etc.
* Reports for various departments such as technical services and hotel liaison

## Requirements
* PHP 7.4 or greater (mostly tested on 8.1, but there may be some minor issues with 8.X)
  * XSLT library
  * Multibyte library (mbstring)
* Apache or Nginx (Should be able to run on other web servers than can handle PHP and MySQL, but not tested)
* MySQL or MariaDB (Tested on MySQL 5.6 & 8.0, and on MariaDB 10.5)
* SMTP connection for use as mail relay (only if you want to send email from PlanZ)
  * Note: many hosts limit use of their mail relays in ways not compatible with PlanZ
* The participant photo upload option requires the PHP extension GD library
