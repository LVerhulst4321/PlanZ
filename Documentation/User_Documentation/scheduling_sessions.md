# Scheduling Sessions

At some point, you'll want to schedule sessions. Often, you'll schedule a session after you've assigned
participants, but it's not fully necessary.

PlanZ includes two tools that you can use for scheduling:

1. The "Maintain Room Schedule" tool; and
2. The "Grid Scheduler".

Both of these tools can be found in the "Scheduling" nav drop-down.

Each tool has some limitations and advantages.

## Maintain Room Schedule

The "Maintain Room Schedule" tool works with a single room at a time. First you can select the room,
and then you can add sessions to the room's schedule.

The limitation of the Maintain Room Schedule tool is that it requires a number of fussy steps to get a
session scheduled. But it's quite flexible in terms of allowing you to schedule any event at any time.

## Grid Scheduler

The "Grid Scheduler" tool assumes that all sessions fit neatly into a grid. And that's probably its
biggest limitation, because it's not always true.

But on the plus side, you can work with multiple rooms at a time, and assign sessions a bit more
easily to the grid.

# Review Your Work

Under the "Scheduling" nav bar drop-down, there's a "Current Schedule" nav item. You can use this
option to review what sessions are currently scheduled in what rooms.

# Additional Consideration

Potential participants have probably given some indications that:

1. They have time periods where they might be available to be on sessions; and
2. They might have other preferences about being on sessions (like, "Please don't schedule me on a session with Joe; we have a really complicated history.")

PlanZ does not (and in many cases cannot) enforce these constraints. But there are various conflict reports that are probably worth reviewing.
