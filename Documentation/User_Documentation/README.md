# Running a Con with PlanZ

PlanZ is a con programme scheduling webapp, and is intended to help with the running of fan-run SF cons. It might be applicable for other types of conventions, but the original developers of the webapp were SF con team members, and that's the domain that this webapp specializes in.

## The Overall Con Planning Structure

### Initial Webapp Set-up

Before the convention committee start doing their work the site administrator needs to perform some set-up activities.

### Programming Sessions

Different cons work in different ways but I'd argue that -- at the high level -- there are a number of common activities. The details may vary from con to con, but each con probably needs to address the following things:

1. [Create Sessions](./creating_sessions.md) - One of the early activities involves deciding what sessions the con is going to offer. Depending on the con these sessions could include panel, workshops, film showings, tabletop games, author readings, and so forth. Different cons figure out how to create sessions differently. They might, for example:
   - have a programming team who thinks up the potential sessions
   - solicit ideas about programming sessions from the community by sharing a Google form or encouraging attendees to send emails
   - solicit ideas from folks using PlanZ's brainstorming feature.
2. Vet the Initial Session List - Usually, the programming team will quickly vet the initial session list, looking to clean up suggestions that have been badly expressed, or consolidate duplicate ideas.
3. Gauge Panelist Interest - Once a number of draft sessions have been assembled, the programming team will be interested in figuring out how to get knowledgable panelists or participants to indicate their willingness to be on panels.
4. [Assign Participants](./assign_participants.md) - The programming team will assign participants to sessions, based on their interests and willingness to be participants.
5. [Schedule Sessions](./scheduling_sessions.md) - Once participants are assigned, the programming team figures out how to schedule each session based on room and participant availability.
6. Notification and Acceptance - Once a draft schedule is available, potential panelists might need to confirm that they'll be part of the sessions that they've been scheduled on. This might be a formal or informal process.
7. Publish the Schedule - After the schedule is mostly finalized, the schedule is published: this might include:
   - in print;
   - on the website; or
   - on a mobile app.

PlanZ has tools that can help a programming team with each of the above options.
